How to use the volume of data from smart meters to promote and improve efficiency and sustainability of
demand has become a major research topic worldwide. Control decisions for the smart grid should be made

continuously at both the aggregate and granular levels. Power distribution companies rely on forecasts with
different time horizons to support both system operability and planning. Retail electricity suppliers are
making pricing, procurement and hedging decisions based largely on the expected load of their customers
greater use of renewable energy sources, which results in a load profile increasingly characterized by the
presence of peaks in consumption due to human behavior, that can lead to problems for electricity providers.
This work has found application the forecast of energy consumption over time allows property and building
managers to plan energy consumption over time, shifting energy use to off-peak periods, improving energy
purchase plans, and allowing them to assess their consumption habits.
